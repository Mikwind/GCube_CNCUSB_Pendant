# GCube_CNCUSB_Pendant
Use a Game cube controller and an arduino to make a jogging pendant for CNC machines!
This was made for the CNCUSB MK1 hardware from planetCNC,  but will work with any CNC card that accepts 5V digital 
outputs for jogging for the axes, and an 0V-5V analog input for the jogging speed
